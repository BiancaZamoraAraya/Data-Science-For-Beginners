# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education | User needs to improve education process for children in schools, based on their development, in a certain location (state, country, etc.). | Total population of children attending school and their grades (personal information such as age, gender an nationality, if possible), the amount of time dedicated to asignatures and the amount of time dedicated to assigments, as well as the day of the week they work on them. Their califications of standarized tests. | The data could be stored in a structured form such as tables. | Insights: Which age are children most involved with school subjects, which asignatures are they more interested in and which ones they need to improve. Decisitions: have certain subjects to spend more time on. |
| Vaccination | User needs to control vaccination during the pandemic, in a certain location (school, university, state, country, etc.). | Total population as well as vaccined (or not) population, including the date (hour, even), the place of vaccination and the vaccine. If possible, personal information such as gender, nationality, age. | The data could be stored in a structured form such as tables. | Insights: which age-group is being (or not) vacccined, the most concurred places to get vaccined. Decisions: which hgroup of people should be encouraged to get vaccined.|
| Productivity | User needs to determine if they are being productive at work hours based on their activity in their computer. | The time spent of the computer softwares and which softwares were (they could be categorized), including the clicks (to evidence actual activity in the apps). | The data could be stored in a structured form such as tables. | Insights: know how the time is being used at work. Decisions: Use one software more than the other.|

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
